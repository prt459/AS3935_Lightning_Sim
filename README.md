# AS3935_Lightning_Sim
# Simulates lightning to trigger an AS3935 lightning detector.  
#
# A simple Arduino script that turns on three si5351 clocks to fixed frequenbcies for a short, partly randomised period, then waits for a part randomised interval.  
# If necessary, an amplifier will be added to the three clock signals to bring it up to a level suitable for detection by an AS3935.
